## Data Learning ##
The aim of this repository is to structure the curriculum for my self learning process for data science. I'm coming into this with a background in applied mathematics, finance, and programming. Some of the curriculum will be a refresher while other areas will be completely new.

Before diving into the curriculum I want to quote John Foreman,  the Chief Data Scientist for MailChimp.com. From his blog post [Don't Forget the "What" and "Why" in Big Data](http://www.john-foreman.com/blog/dont-forget-the-what-and-why-in-big-data):

> If I can't clearly articulate to my peers what my analytics project is and why I'm doing it, then forget everything else.
>
> . . .
>
> I obsess over what business problem I should be solving with analytics and why they need solving. What does it get my company (MailChimp), and how does it help our customers?
>
> Can you articulate the business problem that you're throwing software, talent, and hardware at? Or are you just buying tools that are looking for a use?

While going down the self learning route, don't forget the ***what*** and ***why*** I'm learning data science. Without keeping that in mind, it's all for naught.

It's also good to keep in mind that ***technology is a wonderful tool, but terrible master***. I love geeking out on data and technology, but at the end of the day I need to make sure it is serving me, not the other way around.
