## Data Learning ##
The aim of this repository is to structure the curriculum for my self learning process for data science. I'm coming into this with a background in applied mathematics, finance, and programming. Some of the curriculum will be a refresher while other areas will be completely new.

Before diving into the curriculum I want to quote John Foreman,  the Chief Data Scientist for MailChimp.com. From his blog post [Don't Forget the "What" and "Why" in Big Data](http://www.john-foreman.com/blog/dont-forget-the-what-and-why-in-big-data):

> If I can't clearly articulate to my peers what my analytics project is and why I'm doing it, then forget everything else.
>
> . . .
>
> I obsess over what business problem I should be solving with analytics and why they need solving. What does it get my company (MailChimp), and how does it help our customers?
>
> Can you articulate the business problem that you're throwing software, talent, and hardware at? Or are you just buying tools that are looking for a use?

While going down the self learning route, don't forget the ***what*** and ***why*** I'm learning data science. Without keeping that in mind, it's all for naught.

It's also good to keep in mind that ***technology is a wonderful tool, but terrible master***. I love geeking out on data and technology, but at the end of the day I need to make sure it is serving me, not the other way around.

Also, before going deeper in the world of online learning resources, it's timely to quote another of John Foreman's blog posts. This time from [The $30/hr Data Scientist](http://www.john-foreman.com/blog/the-30hr-data-scientist):

> The types of data scientists who command large salaries seem to meet two very different definitions than what a freelancer at $30/hr can meet:
>
> 1) There's the highly-technical engineer. Someone who is knowledgeable and skilled enough to select the correct tools and infrastructure in the polluted big-data landscape to solve a specific, highly-technical data problem. Often these folks are working on problems that haven't been solved before or if they have there are only a few poorly documented examples. Because these tasks might not even be solvable, they're certainly not "well-defined." A business wouldn't trust important bits of infrastructure to $30/hr.
>
> 2) There's the data scientist as communicator/translator. This person is someone who knows data science techniques intimately but whose strength is actually in the nontechnical -- this person thrives on taking an ambiguous business situation and distilling it into a data science solution. Often managers and executives don't know what's possible. They know what problems they have, but they don't know how or even if data science can solve those problems. These folks can't hire someone halfway across the globe at $30/hr to figure that out for them. No, they need someone who's deeply technical but also deeply personable in the office to talk things through with them and guide them.

> A data scientist is not someone putting doors on an automobile in a factory. Some of them might be doing just that, i.e. rote modeling tasks. But not all of them. **I believe that MOOCs will excel at teaching up an army of these lower-paid data scientists**. And that's great. They'll fill a need.

> However, there will always be a place for those who excel at solving ambiguous technological & business problems. And they'll cost more than $30/hr.

What this curriculum won't cover are the soft skills, but that's not to undermine their importance. In fact, they might be quite a bit more important than the hard skills. I'm not the first to point this out. From Dale Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, a book published October 1936:

> Research done a few years ago under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching uncovered a most important and significant fact -- a fact later confirmed by the additional studies made at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. These investigations revealed that even in such technical lines as engineering, **about 15 percent of one's financial success is due to one's technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering** -- to personality and the ability to lead people.
