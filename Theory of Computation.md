**Why Study Theory?**

> Finally, theory is good for you because studying it expands your mind. Computer technology changes quickly. Specific technical knowledge, though useful today, becomes outdated in just a few years. Consider instead the abilities to think, to express yourself clearly and precisely, to solve problems, and to know when you haven't solved a problem. These abilities have lasting value. Studying theory trains you in these areas.

**Useful Quotes**

On designing finite automata
> Whether it be of automaton or artwork, design is a creative process. As such it cannot be reduced to a simple recipe or formula. However, you might find a particular approach helpful when designing various types of automata. That is, put *yourself* in the place of the machine you are trying to design and then see how you would go about performing the machine's task. Pretending that you are the machine is a psychological trick that helps engage your whole mind in the design process.
